    <h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis by Natalie Yehle</h1>
    
    <p>Eastern Hellbenders are only one of three giant salamanders in the world. 
        They are listed on North Carolina's endangered species list as a species of special concern.
        Hellbenders are found in fast-moving, clean streams in western North Carolina and their population has declined due to habitat loss and illegal killings.
        They aren't the most attractive (see picture) and at over a foot long they can look quite scary, but they are not harmful, poisonous, venomous, or toxic.
    </p>

    <p>I had the question: where exactly in NC can we expect to find hellbenders?
        To answer this, I found a CSV file of all giant salamander sightings in the world.
        Then, I used the intersect geoprocessing tool to restrict the sightings to those just in NC.
        There are no other giant salamanders found in North Carolina, so the intersected points are only hellbender sightings.
        Next, I created a convex hull that encompassed all of the hellbender sightings in NC in order to see what their range is.
        I also included major river and stream systems in NC to see what bodies of water hellbenders can be/ have been found

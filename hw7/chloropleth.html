<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Natalie Yehle</h2>
<h3>This map displays the prevalence of poverty across counties in North Carolina. Counties in darker green have more people in poverty than those in lighter green. At first I was surprised because I thought that the rural counties, like those in the west, would have higher cases of poverty. However, this dataset is number of people in poverty per county, so it makes sense that counties with more people (like Wake and Mecklenburg counties) would have higher numbers of poverty.</h3>

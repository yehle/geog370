<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Natalie Yehle</h2>
<h3>This map displays the prevalence of Medicaid/ other means-tested health coverage across municipalities in Puerto Rico. Medicaid is managed by the states according to federal guidelines. Low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid. There are also other needs-based public health insurance other than Medicaid, which are also included in my map. 
    
    I choose to do a chloropleth of Medicaid and means-tested health coverage in Puerto Rico because access to quality health coverage is very important to me. Puerto Rico is often overlooked in regards of health care because it is a territory, not a state, of the U.S.

    <h1>Homework 9: Choropleth of Cambodia by Natalie Yehle</h1>
    
    <p>Due to nearly three decades of constant warfare. It is estimated that there are between 4 and 6 million unexploded landmines and other explosive remnants of war (ERW).
        However, other estimates go as high as tens of millions.
        Cambodia has about 40,000 amputees, most of which result from landmine and ERW explosions. 
        From 2014-2015 there were 247 mine/ ERW casualties across the 25 Cambodian provinces, plus their capital.
        I chose this topic because I heard about the Cambodian landmine problem in a TikTok and I was interested.

    <h2>Rate of Landmine/ ERW Casualties in Cambodian Provinces, 2014-2015</h2>
    <p>This map shows that the majority of landmine/ ERW casualties occur in the northern-western provinces, especially along the border with Vietnam. 
        One reason is that U.S. troops put them there during the Vietnam War. 
        Also, these areas are less populated than other provinces, so historically removal efforts here have not been as prioritized.
        This map is in the ESPG:4131 projection.
